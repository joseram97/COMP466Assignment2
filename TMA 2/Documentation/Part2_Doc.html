				<h1>Assignment 2 - Part 2 Documentation</h1>
			</div>
			<h2>Description and Requirements</h2>
            <p>This part of the assignment involves creating an online web course site that will enable learners to sign up and take some courses created by subject matter experts (SMEs). This project is to use the knowledge gained from using php and MySQL to create a seemless experience. The requirements will be listed below, based on their sections</p>
            <p>
                <h3>Here are the requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a multi-paged online learning course website to help users learn about various topics the <strong>Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)</strong> create</li>
                    <li>Utilize a simple login/log-out system to keep track of the "learning" users and the SMEs</li>
                    <li>Utilize an <strong>Education Mark-up Language (EML)</strong> for SMEs to use and create their courses for the site</li>
                    <li>
                        The EML should be able to
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allow SME to create units</li>
                            <li>Allow the SME to create lessons within the units</li>
                            <li>Allow the SME to add images to lessons to enhance learning</li>
                            <li>For every unit created, a quiz is also to be setup with as many questions as they like</li>
                            <li>Be setup in an easy to read and use form</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The website must be able to parse the EML and display it as html content for the user to view the courses, units, lessons and quizzes. This is done with the creation of a parser</li>
                    <li>
                        The website must be able to
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allows users to login and signup</li>
                            <li>Allows "learners" to enroll/un-enroll courses available on the website</li>
                            <li>Allows SMEs to upload an EML based file (along with the option to upload images with the EML file as well)</li>
                            <li>Allow SMEs to view the courses that they uploaded to ensure the quality of the course</li>
                            <li>Allow SMEs to update their courses with a new EML file (and newer images)</li>
                            <li>SMEs can delete any course that they've created</li>
                            <li>Both Learners and SMEs must be able to view <i>Quizzes</i> on a seperate web page and take the test, showing results</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The website must be presented in a professional manner, with a simple to understand user-interface</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
			<hr>
			<h2>Design and Analysis</h2>
			<p>
                The design and analysis of my solution for creating this online course website will be described through the following sections:
                <ul>
                    <li>Website Layouts</li>
                    <li>EML Design</li>
                    <li>Database Design</li>
                    <li>
                        Data Flow
                        <ul>
                            <li>Learner Enrolling/Un-enrolling</li>
                            <li>Learner/SME Viewing Course/Quizzes</li>
                            <li>SME Creating/Removing Course</li>
                            <li>Anonymous User on HomePage</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        EML Parser
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Website Layout</h3>
            <p>
                The entire course will be structured with 3 pages
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Home Page/Course Management Page
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This page will be the "main home page" for the entire course, both for logged in users and non-logged in users. The <i>Home Page</i> part will showcase some of the available courses from the website. It will also include the <strong>Log in</strong> and <strong></strong>Sign up</strong> buttons for a user to either create a new account, or log in with their existing credentials.
                                Once a user logs in or signs up, the page will then change to the <i>Course Management</i> page. This new page will be different for either <strong>Learners</strong> and <strong>Subject Matter Experts</strong>. For <strong>Learners</strong> they will be shown 2 lists. One list will showcase all of the courses the user is enrolled in, and another list showcasing all of the available courses given by the website. The Learner will be able to enroll and un-enroll within this page.
                                For the <strong>SME</strong> within the same page, they will only be shown 1 list, showcasing all of the courses that they have created and uploaded to website. For <strong>both</strong> types of users, this page will allow users to click and select a course to view in the <strong>Course Viewer</strong> page and see the quizzes in the <strong>Course Quiz</strong> viewer page.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Course Viewer
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This page will show the same course contents for the <strong>Learner</strong> and <strong>SME</strong>. For the <i>Course Viewer</i> page, it will show all of the course contents, including the units within the courses, their lessons, and any image media. These contents will be grabbed with the database server. Additionally, another page called the <i>Course Quiz</i> page will showcase all of the available quizzes for each of the units within the course.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Course Quiz Viewer
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This page will show the same course contents for the <strong>Learner</strong> and <strong>SME</strong>. The page called the <i>Course Quiz</i> page will showcase all of the available quizzes for each of the units within the course. The contents will be grabbed by the database server.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <i><strong>NOTE: </strong> all of the pages will also include a <strong>Sign out</strong> button to sign out and redirect to the home page at any time.</i>
            </p>
            <h3>EML Design</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Educational Markup Language</strong> should be designed to be easy to understand and easy to create courses. The following tags were set up with corresponding attributes.
                <ul>

            <h3>EML Parser</h3>
            <p>
                The EML Parser is relatively simple and has been partially described earlier. But here is the process
                <ul>
                    <li>Subject Matter Expert (SME) uploads the EML file (along with photos)</li>
                    <li>PHP will read the EML.xml file and extract and go through the course, unit, lesson, lessonContent, Image, and Quiz information and insert into the MySQL database</li>
                    <li>Now, whenever the a user wants to view a course, after the course is selected PHP server will query the MySQL database and return the course, unit, lesson, lessonContent, image data and added them to created html objects</li>
                    <li>Whenever a user wants to view a quiz, after a quiz is selected PHP server will query the MySQL database to get the quiz data (also based on the course that is selected)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

			<h2>Implementation</h2>
			<p>
                The entire website was created using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and XML technologies. I have tried to make the desktop experience as consistent as possible, sharing the same styles between the course, quiz, and viewer pages. I have kept all of the files within the same folder directory in order to maintain simplicity, and I thought that have 3 different pages (1 for course management, 1 for course viewing, and 1 for quiz taking) helps organize the code a little better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the <strong>part2</strong> folder I have the following sub-folders and their purpose:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>EML</strong> - holds some of the sample EML.xml data to be referenced by a user</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>phpLibrary</strong> - holds seperate php files holding functions that are to be used within the main .php files in the part2 folder
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>EMLFunctions</i> - this php file contains functions for uploading and parsing out an EML file (with images) and transferring contents to a MySQL database. Also contains additional helper functions</li>
                            <li><i>queryFunctions</i> - this php file contains SQL query helper functions to make querying a little bit easier within the main .php pages in the part2 folder</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>SME_Images</strong> - this folder on the server will hold all of the saved images for its courses</li>
                    <li><strong>Test_Images</strong> - a folder to hold sample image data to be uploaded to the server again. <strong>Only have access to this in the local zip file, the test_images will not be stored in the server</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                When setting up the php server within the hosted server, some additional extensions had to be made in order to accomodate larger image and uploads made when creating courses. The following are the following php.ini variables that were modified:
                <ul>
                    <li>post_max_size=50M - the max size that a total file uploads can be is 50 MB</li>
                    <li>upload_max_filesize=15M - the max size that a single file uploaded can be 15MB</li>
                    <li>max_file_uploads=75 - the max number of files that can be uploaded is 75</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, the way the EML process is setup, within some of the tags used, <strong>CDATA</strong> is highly recommended to ensure that it is easier to write additional html elements within some contents. This is helpful for some SMEs that want to bold, italisize, create ordered or unordered lists using <strong>strong, i, ul, ol</strong> list tags. This is evident in the sample EML.xml file that is link in the design description.
            </p>

			<h2>User Guide</h2>
            <p>The following is the user guide explaining how to use the site as a learner and/or as an SME, what pages are available, how to view courses and finally take quizzes.</p>
            <h3>Homepage</h3>
            <p>When you first open the site, you will be greeted with the homepage of the B.O.A.T. Online Course website. From here you can view some of the courses that are available to learn from when you sign up for the website. You can see there is a link to the main <i>TMA 2.html</i> page near the main title of the page. You will also notice that there is a <strong>navigation bar</strong> on the top of the page. At first if you are not logged in, it should only show "home". There is both a <strong>Log In</strong> and <strong>Sign Up</strong> button near the top right of the page.</p>
            <p>
                You will also notice near the bottom of the page a "list" of courses that are available within the course that a Learner may be enroll in.
            </p>
            <p>
                To <strong>Sign Up</strong>, click the <i>Sign up</i> button on the top right of the page, and follow all of the prompts, inputs within to create your user profile. <strong>NOTE:</strong> One thing to keep of note, when you create the user profile, you will also need to select the type of profile you want. You have the choice between a Learner or a Subject Matter Expert (SME). This is important. If you want to be a Learner, select <strong>Learner</strong>, otherwise select <strong>SME</strong>.
                Some errors may pop up, and follow their suggestions to resolve the issues (e.g. username already taken, wrong password input). Once you complete the profile, you will be automatically logged in to the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                To <strong>Log In</strong>, click the <i>Log in</i> button on the top right of the page. You will be prompted to enter your username and password (this is assuming that you have created a profile from the <strong>Sign up</strong> button). Once the correct username and password are entered, you will be logged into the site and be shown the <strong><i>Course Management</i></strong> page.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i><strong>NOTE #1: </strong> If you are an SME, you will be able to manage courses that you have created, and be able to view courses and take "mock" quizzes</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i><strong>NOTE #2: </strong> To sign out anytime, click the "Sign Out" button on the top right of the page</i>
            </p>
            <h3>Course Management - Learner</h3>
            <p>
                When you log in as a Learner, you will notice that you are directed to the Course Mangement page. From here you will be shown 2 lists. One for the courses that you are enrolled in, and another showing all of the courses that are available on the website. As learner, you can enroll in courses by clicking the <strong>+</strong> button on any of the courses. To un-enroll in courses, on the left list, simply click the "trash" remove button to not have the course.
                You may view the course and its units by simply clicking the area where it says <i>Click here to select the course</i> and you will be redirected to the <strong>Course Viewing</strong> page
            </p>
            <h3>Course Viewing</h3>
            <p>
                Within this page, you will now notice that there are multiple navigation buttons near the top of the page.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Course Management:</strong> will take you back to the course management page to view courses available on the site (or if you are an SME, add/remove courses that you have created)</li>
                    <li><strong>Course Viewer:</strong> will open the main course page to be able to view all of the course material, including the units and lessons</li>
                    <li><strong>Course Quizzes:</strong> view all of the available quizzes for each of the units</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                On the left of the page is the <strong>Unit Selector</strong> pane, where all of the available units are visible and to view them, simply click on the unit name that you desire. The unit will be visible within the page, and you can view and study the material.
            </p>
            <h3>Quizzes</h3>
            <p>
                Within this page, you will be able to quiz yourself on the units that were available within the course. On the left, you will see the <strong>Quiz Selector</strong> pane. To select a quiz, click on any of the quiz names (based on their unit number) and all the questions will be visible. Please ensure to select an answer for each of the questions before clicking <strong>Submit</strong>. Once you click <strong>Submit</strong> the number of correct answers will be visible, along with your
                percentage mark. To view any wrong answers, simply scroll through the questions and look at a question that resulted in showing a red box. There, it will tell you what the correct answer is so that you may learn and try again the next time.
            </p>
            <h3>Course Management - SME</h3>
            <p>
                As a <strong>Subject Matter Expert</strong> you will be given power to create courses that other users can sign up for! After signing up as an SME, you will be redirected to the <strong>Course Management</strong> page. From here, it will look a little bit more different than when a Learner has logged in. You will notice that there is only a single list. This list will show all of the courses that you, as an SME, have created for the website. You can create/edit/remove any of these courses
            </p>
            <h3>Course Creation - SME</h3>
            <p>
                To create a course, you have to understand the <strong>Educational Markup Language (EML)</strong> used for organizing the contents of the course. Your course may include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Units</li>
                    <li>Lessons for each unit</li>
                    <li>Quizzes (1 for each unit)</li>
                    <li>Image media</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to make the creation of the courses easier, the EML has been set up with easy to understand tags. To view an example of the EML file, <a href="../part2/EML/EML.xml">Click Here</a> or click the hyperlink on the course management page. Ensure that the contents of the course match the framework of this EML and are initially saved as an .xml file locally within your computer.
                <i><strong>NOTE #1: </strong> With the contents of any of these tags, you must use the <code>&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;</code> wrapper to "escape" any characters that would not translate as a string to the database server. Some examples of what that may look like can be found <a href="../part2/EML/EML_Course1.xml">here</a></i>
                <i><strong>NOTE #2: </strong> When referencing images within your EML file, ensure that the name of the images are the same as the images that are going to be uploaded to the server</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once your images (.png, .jpg, .gif) and EML file are ready locally, simply click the <strong>Create Course</strong> button on the left of the page. From the prompt, select the EML file, and the corresponding images. Wait for the contents to completely load. <i><strong>NOTE: </strong> some errors may show. Please read them carefully and fix the issues (e.g. number of quizzes don't match number of units, the course name is already taken</i>
                Once the uploading is complete, you should be able to see you course visible within the course list on the main page. You may view the contents of the course by clicking the <i>Click here to select course</i> button. You will be redirected to the <strong>Course Viewer</strong> page and can view the units, and check out the quizzes in the <strong>Course Quizzes</strong> page by click the <strong>Course Quizzes</strong> navigation button on the top of the web page.
            </p>
            <p>
                To <strong>edit</strong> a course, simply click the edit (i.e. pencil icon) button on the course, and upload the modified EML file, and include all of the original and newly added/removed images through the upload process. To <strong>remove</strong> a course, simply click the delete (i.e. trash can icon) button and the course will be removed, and will not be visible to Learners and anyone else using the site.
